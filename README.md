> Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives - choice, not chance, determines your destiny. -[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle)


## Overvuew 

In this lab, you'll create, manipulate, and iterate over arrays. 

## Playground Files

* There's something slightly different about this lab compared to other labs. It's asking that you open up the .playground file included with this repository. In particular, the `ArrayIteration.playground` file.

* When you open a playground file, it should look like this:

* You will be met with a numbered list of questions. These questions require answers! You will write your code below each question. Lets pretend that the first question here asked me to create a function called `iLoveFood()` which prints out the following statement, 'Food is great!'.

* Once you've gone through and answered all of the necessary questions within the playground file, you can now submit a pull request (Don't forget first to git add, git commit and git push your changes). There are **no** tests associated with the playground files.

* What exactly is a Playground file? A *playground* is an interactive Swift coding environment that evaluates each statement and displays results as updates are made, without the need to create project. Here's an example:

* Notice how in the right pane, the playground file is able to compile and run this code *while* I'm typing it in. That's awesome and makes it a really great tool to learn how to code. As you move forward in your "learning how to program" career, if you're ever challenged with a topic or want to brush up on some material, create your own *playground* by launching Xcode and just start writing some code!

## Learning Objectives 

* Create `for-in` loops
* Use `enumerate()` to get the `index` and `element` from the array
* Create `Array` variables and constants and know how to use them
* Know how to create an `Array` of `Int`'s and `String`'s
* Create functions that take in `Array`'s as arguments
* Access elements of the `Array` using *subscript syntax*
* Change elements at a specific index using *subscript syntax* 

## Instructions

* Open up the playground file and answer the listed questions writing your code below each question.
* There are no tests associated with this playground file.
* Make sure render documentation is checked off which can be done in the Hide or show Utilities pane.
* Render Documentaiton *should* be checked by default, but you can check to see that it is here:

* This allows for the questions to look all pretty in larger font that disallows you to mistakenly change the questions when you just mean to be writing code. You can include Markdown within a *playground* file which is pretty cool, it allows us to format the file in a clean way that allows you to just focus on the code.
