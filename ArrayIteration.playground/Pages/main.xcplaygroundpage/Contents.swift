/*: question1
 ### 1. You're building an app and want to store all of the ingredients added to a cart into an `Array`. The ingredients are "Chips", "Salsa", "Guacamole", and "Red wine". Name this `Array` variable whatever you like, think of a name which makes sense.
 */
// write your code here

var inCart = ["Chips","Salsa","Guacamole","Red Wine"]

/*: question2
 ### 2. You need to create a list that contains the numbers from 1 to 10. How would you represent this list in code?
 */
// write your code here

var numbersList: [Int] = []
for number in 1...10 {
    numbersList.append(number)
}
print(numbersList)

/*: question3
 ### 3. Take the list of numbers you created in question 2 and print their values in the most efficient way possible. (Hint: for-in loop).
 */
// write your code here

for number in numbersList {
    print(number)
}

/*: question4
 ### 4. Take the list of shopping cart items you created in question 1 and iterate through it printing each item to the console.
 */
// write your code here

for item in inCart {
    print(item)
}

/*: question5
 ### 5. Create a function that takes an array of names and greets each person with the following message "Good morning x" <- x being the individuals name. One caveat. If the persons first name is Michael, we want to greet them with the message, "Top of the morning Michael!".
 */
// write your code here

func greeting(people: [String]) {
    
    for person in people {
        if person == "Michael" {
            print("Top of the morning \(person)")
        } else {
            print( "Good morning \(person)")
        }
        
    }
}

/*: question6
 ### 6. Create a function that takes an array of Ints and returns an array of Ints. This function should look through the array of Ints and create a new array of Ints that only contain integers less than 50.
 */
// write your code here

func checkOut(numbers: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    var lessThanFifty: [Int] = []
    for number in numbers {
        if number < 50 {
            lessThanFifty.append(number)
        }
    }
    return lessThanFifty
}
